This is an implementation of HW6 (ray tracer) of CS4300 in Spring 2011 at NEU:

http://www.ccs.neu.edu/course/cs4300/HW6/HW6.html

Fellow students: You have been warned.

(Packaged with Leiningen.)

If you want a *good* ray tracer with all the usual features, may I recommend
looking at https://code.google.com/p/cray/ instead.
